## Overview

These extensions were built to simplify the Polymarket interface by ensuring that all available betting options are visible without scrolling. Whether you prefer the simpler approach of PolyView or the enhanced layout of PolyView+, you can now see every bet immediately upon loading the page.

*Note: I created these extensions solely for my own convenience while checking odds for events. **No ongoing support or feature updates will be provided.***

## Disclaimer

These Chrome extensions are offered as-is without any warranty or guarantee of continued functionality. I built them to help me view all betting options on Polymarket, and while I don't expect them to cause any issues, I cannot guarantee they will always work if Polymarket changes its website. **No support or further feature updates will be provided.**

Use at your own risk.
